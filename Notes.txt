Backpropagation is a fundamental concept in training neural networks, including the one used in your script for stock price prediction. It's not explicitly shown line by line in the output because it happens internally within the TensorFlow library during the training process (model.fit() function call). However, the effects of backpropagation are reflected in the changing values of the loss and metrics (like MAE - Mean Absolute Error) across epochs.

Here's a simplified explanation of how backpropagation relates to what's happening during the training:

Initial Forward Pass: For the first epoch, the model makes predictions based on the initial random weights. The difference between these predictions and the actual values produces an initial loss (error).

Backpropagation: Based on this initial error, backpropagation algorithm calculates gradients for each weight in the network, indicating how the loss would change with a small change in that weight.

Weight Update: Using these gradients, the optimizer updates the weights in the direction that reduces the loss. The size of the step taken in this direction is controlled by the learning rate.

Subsequent Epochs: The process repeats for each epoch. With each forward pass, backpropagation, and weight update cycle, the model's predictions should (ideally) become more accurate, and the loss should decrease, as observed in the output logs.

Monitoring Validation Loss: Alongside training loss, the validation loss is also monitored. It's calculated using a separate part of the dataset not used for training (to prevent overfitting). This helps in understanding how well the model generalizes.

To better illustrate backpropagation in action, consider logging the gradients of some specific weights or layers after each epoch. However, this would require custom callbacks and potentially altering the model training code to access and log these gradients, which might complicate the simplicity of your current script.

For educational purposes, if you want to illustrate backpropagation more concretely, consider building a very simple neural network (maybe with one or two layers) and manually computing the forward pass, loss, gradients, and weight updates for a very small dataset. This manual computation can showcase the essence of backpropagation more vividly but is beyond the scope of using high-level libraries like TensorFlow or Keras directly.

and XBoost algorithm doesnt use backpropagation?

No, the XGBoost algorithm does not use backpropagation. XGBoost stands for eXtreme Gradient Boosting and belongs to a family of boosting algorithms, which are based on ensemble learning. In ensemble learning, multiple models (often called "weak learners") are trained to solve the same problem and combined to get better results. The basic principle behind boosting algorithms is to train weak learners sequentially, each trying to correct its predecessor's mistakes.

Here's a simplified overview of how XGBoost works:

Initial Model: XGBoost starts with an initial model, which could be as simple as predicting the average value for regression tasks. This model's predictions are likely to be quite inaccurate, resulting in a high error.

Gradient Calculation: Instead of backpropagation, XGBoost calculates gradients of the loss function with respect to the predictions of the current model. These gradients represent the direction and rate at which the loss would decrease the most rapidly and are used to guide the training of the next model.

Train Next Model: A new model (usually a decision tree) is trained to predict the residuals or errors made by the previous models. In other words, it learns from the mistakes of the preceding ensemble of models.

Update Ensemble: The predictions from the new model are scaled by a learning rate and added to the predictions of the existing ensemble of models to update the overall predictions. This process aims to gradually reduce the error of the ensemble model.

Iterate: Steps 2-4 are repeated for a predefined number of rounds, or until the improvement falls below a certain threshold. Each new model is trained to correct the residual errors made by the combined ensemble of all previous models.

Output Final Model: The final model is the sum of the scaled predictions of all individual models. This ensemble model is used for making predictions on new data.

In summary, XGBoost improves its model by learning from the residuals of previous models and adjusting accordingly, using gradient information. In contrast, backpropagation is used in neural networks to update the weights of the network layers based on the gradient of the loss function with respect to each weight.
